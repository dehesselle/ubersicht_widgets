# Übersicht Widgets
These are the widgets for [Übersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/) that I'm using. This repository is meant as backup for the customizations that I've made.

## Widgets
- [Battery Charge](https://github.com/bcseda/BatteryCharge)
- [Bluetooth Battery Bar](https://github.com/gschrader/ubersicht-bluetooth-battery-bar)
- [Load Bar](https://github.com/ttscoff/ubersicht-widgets/tree/master/loadbar)
- [Time Machine Status](https://github.com/rudders/tmstatus)
- [Weather](https://github.com/felixhageloh/weather-widget)

## Customizations
![alt-text](/screenshot.jpg)
Beyond adjusting the refresh rate, I...
- moved all battery-related stuff to lower right corner.
- moved weather to upper left corner and hard-coded my location.
- increased the upper limit of load bar to be suitable for 8 cores. Furthermore, the load bar is not shown for loads below 2.
